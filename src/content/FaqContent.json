If you are new, you must have already done some quick research through google search and youtube, it's a good start. But the information you received must be generic and you must still have some questions that is personal to your situation. Your next options are either to call a mutual fund house, who will then start promoting you their products! or find a consultant who will charge you 500-1000 rupees a call. This is a gap that we want to fill. Give unbiased expert advice at the lowest cost possible."
